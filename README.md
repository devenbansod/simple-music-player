# simple-music-player
Simple browser-based music player to play a folder as a playlist


Steps to use:
--------------
1. Download the php_music.php file.
2. Now open the php_music.php file with notepad and edit the top section to set the value of
	`$curr_dir` variable to the location of folder that contains the MP3s you want to play
	Ex. $curr_dir = '/home/deven/my_mp3s/';
3. Alternatively, if you want to avoid editing the file, you could just copy the file to any folder containing the mp3s.
4. Now, go to the terminal and run the command `php -S localhost:8000`. (where 8000 can be replaced with any port number)
